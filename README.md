# Live-facial-emotion-recognition
Live facial emotion recognition is a Python demo that trains a compact CNN on FER-2013 to classify seven emotions, then uses OpenCV Haar cascades to detect faces in your webcam, preprocess each crop, run real-time inference, and overlay emotion labels on the video feed.
